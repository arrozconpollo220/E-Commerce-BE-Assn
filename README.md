  ## Description
  This application is the back end of an E-commerce website. Since there is no front end on this application, we will go through a demonstration of the tables being created and seeded. There will also be a demonstration with the Insomnia application on how we can get all, get one, update, create and delete Categories, Products and Tags. You can interact and test your Postgres database as well.

  ## Installation
  The following was used to create this application: VS Code, GitHub, NPM Packages Dotenv, Express, PG, & Sequalize. JavaScript, Insomnia and my computer terminal.

  ## Usage
  This application can be used to test, debug and interact with your Postgres database without having a front end through the Insomnia application. I have set up 15 actions to be processed in Insomnia. Get all categories, get one category, update a category, create a category and delete a category. Get all products, get one product, update a product, create a product and delete a product. Get all tags, get one tag, update a tag, create a tag and delete a tag.
